Building an internal infrastructure pipeline for Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic data preprocessing and visualization in R involves the following steps:

- Data collection: This involves the collection of raw data from various sources such as clinical trials, research studies, or observational studies.
- Data preprocessing: This is the process of cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. It involves tasks such as data cleaning, missing value imputation, data transformation, and data integration.
- Data analysis: This involves the application of statistical techniques to the preprocessed data to generate insights and identify patterns. This step involves tasks such as data modeling, statistical inference, and data visualization.
- Results reporting: This involves the generation of reports and visualizations to communicate the results of the data analysis to stakeholders.


To build the internal infrastructure pipeline for Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic data preprocessing and visualization in R, the following steps can be taken:

### Step 1: Data collection

Identify the sources of the raw data and obtain access to the data.
Determine the scope of the data collection, including the data types, format, and structure.
Develop a data collection plan and establish data governance policies to ensure the security, accuracy, and privacy of the data.

### Step 2: Data preprocessing

Clean and transform the raw data using R packages such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `data.table`.
Perform missing value imputation using R packages such as `impute`, `missForest`, and VIM.
Transform the data using R packages such as `scales`, `caret`, and `MLmetrics`.
Integrate data from multiple sources using R packages such as `merge`, `join`, and `rbind`.

### Step 3: Data analysis

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using R packages such as `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and `lattice`.
Apply statistical modeling techniques using R packages such as `nlme`, `lme4`, and `survival`.
Perform hypothesis testing and statistical inference using R packages such as `stats`, `car`, and `psych`.
Visualize the results using R packages such as `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and `shiny`.

### Step 4: Results reporting

Generate reports using [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), or [Sweave](https://rpubs.com/YaRrr/SweaveIntro).
Create visualizations using R packages such as `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and `shiny`.
Use interactive dashboards and web applications using R packages such as `shiny`, `flexdashboard`, and `shinydashboard`.

In summary, building an internal infrastructure pipeline for Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic data preprocessing and visualization in R involves data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and results reporting using a variety of R packages and tools. By following these steps, stakeholders can gain insights into the data and make data-driven decisions to improve drug development and patient outcomes.
